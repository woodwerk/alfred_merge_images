# Merge images
A file-action triggered work flow to merge multiple images into a single PDF. 
![](https://github.com/woodwerk/alfred_merge_images/blob/master/workflow.png?raw=true)
The heavy lifting is handled by a Python script exploiting the img2pdf library. Select either multiple indivdual images or a folder containing images and the will all get bundled into a single time-stamped PDF placed on the desktop. Note that some PNG images contain an alpha channel that must be removed beforehand.  

This [PDF](https://github.com/woodwerk/alfred_merge_images/blob/master/Merge%20Images%20into%20PDF%20-%20an%20ALFRED%20workflow.pdf) describes the workflow in more detail.
